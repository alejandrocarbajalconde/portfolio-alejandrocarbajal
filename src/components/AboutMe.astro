      My name is Alejandro Carbajal, but everyone calls me <strong>Alex</strong>
      I'm based in A Coru√±a and currently working as a Product Owner at Inditex in
      the store area.
      <strong> I lead multiple teams as a responsible manager </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Among my key achievements are the continuous improvement in modernizing
      store services and enhancing the user experience. I have also
      significantly improved processes, reducing queue waiting times, and
      streamlined the global deployment of point-of-sale versions across all
      markets. My role involves <strong>interacting with teams worldwide</strong
      >, ensuring a consistent and efficient rollout across all regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm deeply passionate about my city, music, and sports. I love attending <strong
        >concerts and festivals</strong
      >, where I can immerse myself in live music and the vibrant energy of the
      crowd. Additionally, I am a <strong>CrossFit enthusiast</strong>, enjoying
      the challenges and discipline it brings to my daily routine.
      <strong>Traveling is another passion of mine</strong>, as it allows me to
      explore new cultures and gain fresh perspectives, all of which inspire my
      work and life.
